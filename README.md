# System for predicting academic performance

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

As an student I have met a wide variety of colleagues with different backgrounds and different academic success. This projects main goal is to use different AI methods to predict how academically successful will someone be. This might help get some insight in what actually matters when it comes to academic success 


## Background

I have never quite understood why some people are good at school and others are not. I am hoping that this project will help me gain a better understanding of this problem. I am also hoping that this project will enable everyone to get an high-quality prediction of their academic success.


## How is it used?

The project can be used to get personal estimation of academic success, but its main users should be college recruiters, career advisors and simillar roles that could benefit from the insights in someones academic past and future. Basic use case would be entering current personal and academic information and getting a prediction about what how well academically will a person perform (degree of education, field of study, GPA...)




## Data sources and AI methods
I will mainly use The Croatian Bureau of Statistics data and some personally gathered data if needed. I will probably need more AI methods since this is both classification and prediction problem 

## Challenges

Main challenge is to create a model that is borad enough so that anyone in the nation can use it, but specific enough so that it is usefull. 
It is important that users understand that model will generate a prediction and that there is virtually no guarantee that it will be correct.

## What next?

It would be greatly appriciated to get some assistance in increasing the volume and quality of data gathered.
