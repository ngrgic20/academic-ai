# System for predicting academic performance

Building AI course project

## Summary

As a student I have met a wide variety of colleagues with different backgrounds and with varying degrees of academic success. This project's main goal is to use different AI methods to predict how academically successful will someone be. This might provide some insight into what actually matters when it comes to academic success.


## Background

I have never quite understood why some people are good at school and others are not. I am hoping that this project will help me gain a better understanding of this problem. I am also hoping that this project will enable everyone to get a high-quality prediction of their academic success.


## How is it used?

The project can be used to get personal estimation of academic success, but its main users should be college recruiters, career advisors and simillar roles that could benefit from the insights into someone's academic past and future. A basic use case would be entering current personal and academic information and getting a prediction about what how well will a person perform academically (degree of education, field of study, GPA...).




## Data sources and AI methods
I will mainly use data from The Croatian Bureau of Statistics and some personally gathered data if needed. I will probably need more AI methods since this is both a classification and a prediction problem.

## Challenges

The main challenge is to create a model that is broad enough so that anyone in the nation can use it, but specific enough so that it is useful.
It is important that users understand that the model will generate a prediction and that there is virtually no guarantee that it will be correct.

## What next?

It would be greatly appreciated to get some assistance in increasing the volume and quality of data gathered.
